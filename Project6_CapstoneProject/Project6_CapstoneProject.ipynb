The remaining correlation can be accounted for using autoregressive and moving average terms and the differencing terms will be d(1) and D(1). The ACF plot shows a strong negative correlation at lag 1 which is confirmed in the PACF. This suggests an q(1) model since  there is 1 significant lag on ACF and confirmed by PACF. The seasonal lag 12 both in the ACF and PACF shows a need for Q(1). There are 12 months in a year (season).\n",
